# [Project 1: Volterra Equivalent Network Modeling](https://github.com/bchenley/Portfolio)

![](https://github.com/bchenley/Portfolio/blob/main/images/lvn_1input_ar.jpg)

**About**

In this project, we build custom PyTorch modules for the development of Volterra-equivalent networks for time series analysis. The model supports mutli-input, multi-output, nonlinear, nonstationary and autoregressive configurations.
  
**Requirements**  
- Python
- PyTorch
- SciKit Learn
- SciPy

**Data**
 
For illustration, we provides examples of the employed model using synthetic time series data and natural time series data. The natural data can be found here.
  
**Colab**

The Colab notebook for this project can be found here.
